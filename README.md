# Self Improvement Fall 2022

Plans and progress tracking for improving myself during fall 2022.  

## Review documentation and software communication basics 

Improving my knowledge of standards for documenting and communicating software, such as UML, to improve my own work and how I communicate with others.  

- Review UML 
- Draw algorithms to practice through university course in robotics and projects
- Start using flowcharts more for coding projects
- Read up on MarkDown and go through examples on how people use README files

## Broaden coding outside C#

Widening my knowledge outside of C# is fun and makes me appreciate what how much I've learned. I also want to be able to use different tools when needed.

- University course on Python ![](https://geps.dev/progress/100)
- University course on Android development ![](https://geps.dev/progress/100)
- Beginner course on .NET MAUI ![](https://geps.dev/progress/100)
- Own coding project with .NET MAUI - Explored enough
- Read book Rx.NET in Action about reactive programming ![](https://geps.dev/progress/100)
- Practice Rx.Net in own project ![](https://geps.dev/progress/100)
- Coding with AI assistance ![](https://geps.dev/progress/100)

Ideas: 
- Scripting: Powershell, Bash, Linux
- Project with NoSQL

## Cloud

It's fascinating how easy it is to build powerful and scaleable applications.

- Take AZ-204 Microsoft Azure certification ![](https://geps.dev/progress/20)
- Build own practice projects ![](https://geps.dev/progress/0)

## Testing

I really enjoy writing tests, finding bugs in code and building quality. But there are many different ways of writing and thinking about tests that I've encountered among collegues and I want to expand my knowledge here.

- Listen to podcasts on testing: Coding Blocks ![](https://geps.dev/progress/100) 
- Write more than just unit tests for private projects ![](https://geps.dev/progress/100) 
- Read: "C and .NET Core Test-Driven Development" ![](https://geps.dev/progress/30)  
- Read: "The Art of Software Testing" ![](https://geps.dev/progress/30)

Ideas: 
- Setup automated testing pipeline with docker in own project

## Software Architecture

To get better at writing bigger pieces of maintainable software.  

- Study microservices ![](https://geps.dev/progress/100)
- Read "Microservices in .NET" ![](https://geps.dev/progress/100) 
- Create own microservice project ![](https://geps.dev/progress/100)
- Tutorial on Model-View-ViewModel ![](https://geps.dev/progress/100) 
- Read "Head First Design Patterns" ![](https://geps.dev/progress/50)  
- Listen to podcasts on architecture: Coding Blocks ![](https://geps.dev/progress/50)

## Best practices, productivity and wellbeing

Something I'm constantly learning and re-learning. It's a good thing I enjoy it! 

- Read "The Pragmatic Programmer" ![](https://geps.dev/progress/35)
- Develop exercise and training routines ![](https://geps.dev/progress/100)

***

## Docker 

I worked with Docker in my previous job, but Docker is a technology I want to be more comfortable with. Debugging, modifying, and working with containerized code is my focus.

- Debugging docker from tutorial ![](https://geps.dev/progress/100)  
- Use docker in own project ![](https://geps.dev/progress/100)
- Use Kubernetes in own project ![](https://geps.dev/progress/0)
