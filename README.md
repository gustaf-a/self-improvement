# Self Improvement

Plans and progress tracking for improving.  

## Review documentation and software communication basics ![](https://geps.dev/progress/100)  

Improving my knowledge of standards for documenting and communicating software, such as UML, to improve my own work and how I communicate with others.  

- Review UML 
- Draw algorithms to practice through university course in robotics and projects
- Start using flowcharts more for coding projects
- Read up on MarkDown and go through examples on how people use README files

## Broaden coding knowledge outside of C#  ![](https://geps.dev/progress/75)  

Widening my knowledge outside of C# is fun and makes me appreciate what how much I've learned. I also want to be able to use different tools when needed.

- University course on Python ![](https://geps.dev/progress/100)
- University course on Android development ![](https://geps.dev/progress/75)
- Beginner course on .NET MAUI ![](https://geps.dev/progress/100)
- Own coding project with .NET MAUI ![](https://geps.dev/progress/25)

## Testing ![](https://geps.dev/progress/50)  

I really enjoy writing test code and finding bugs in code. But there are many different ways of writing and thinking about test code that I've encountered among collegues. I want to be competent to find bugs and feel that I'm producing quality code.  

- Listen to podcasts on testing: Coding Blocks ![](https://geps.dev/progress/100) 
- Write more than just unit tests for private projects ![](https://geps.dev/progress/100) 
- Read: "C and .NET Core Test-Driven Development" ![](https://geps.dev/progress/20)  
- Read: "The Art of Software Testing" ![](https://geps.dev/progress/20)
- Setup automated testing pipeline with docker in own project ![](https://geps.dev/progress/0)

## Software Architecture ![](https://geps.dev/progress/75)

To get better at writing bigger pieces of maintainable software.  

- Tutorial on Microservices ![](https://geps.dev/progress/100)
- Tutorial on Model-View-ViewModel ![](https://geps.dev/progress/100) 
- Read "Microservices in .NET" ![](https://geps.dev/progress/90) 
- Study design patterns: Read "Head First Design Patterns" ![](https://geps.dev/progress/50)  
- Listen to podcasts on architecture: Coding Blocks ![](https://geps.dev/progress/75)
- Design and create own projects ![](https://geps.dev/progress/85)

## Best practices, productivity and wellbeing ![](https://geps.dev/progress/30)

Something I'm constantly learning and re-learning. It's a good thing I really enjoy it! 

- Read "The Pragmatic Programmer" ![](https://geps.dev/progress/35)
- Develop exercise and training routines ![](https://geps.dev/progress/100)

***

## Docker ![](https://geps.dev/progress/60)  

Docker is a technology I want to be more comfortable with and debugging, modifying and working with containerized code is my focus.

- Learn debugging docker from tutorial ![](https://geps.dev/progress/100)  
- Use docker in own project ![](https://geps.dev/progress/100)
- Use Kubernetes in own project ![](https://geps.dev/progress/0)
