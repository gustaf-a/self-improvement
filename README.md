# Self Improvement

This document shows and outline for my work and plans for addressing areas of improvement.  

## Communication and understanding of Software ![](https://geps.dev/progress/60)  

Improving my knowledge of standards for documenting and communicating software, such as UML, would improve my communication with others and my own work to solve problems.  

- Review UML ![](https://geps.dev/progress/100)  
- Draw algorithms to practice through university course in robotics ![](https://geps.dev/progress/100) 
- Study and use UML for coding projects ![](https://geps.dev/progress/30)

## Testing ![](https://geps.dev/progress/20)  

I really enjoy writing test code and finding bugs in code. But there are many different ways of writing and thinking about test code that I've encountered among collegues. I want to be competent to find bugs and feel that I'm producing quality code.  

- Listen to podcasts on testing: Coding Blocks ![](https://geps.dev/progress/100) 
- Write tests for private projects ![](https://geps.dev/progress/40) 
- Read: "C and .NET Core Test-Driven Development" ![](https://geps.dev/progress/20)  
- Read: "The Art of Software Testing" ![](https://geps.dev/progress/20)

## Software Architecture ![](https://geps.dev/progress/30)

To get better at writing bigger pieces of maintainable software.  

- Listen to podcasts on architecture: Coding Blocks ![](https://geps.dev/progress/60)
- Study design patterns: [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9ejT8FO-7I&list=PLrhzvIcii6GNjpARdnO4ueTUAVR9eMBpc&ab_channel=ChristopherOkhravi) ![](https://geps.dev/progress/50)  
- Read parts of "Designing Data Intensive Applications" ![](https://geps.dev/progress/10)
- Practice writing software ![](https://geps.dev/progress/20)

## Networking  ![](https://geps.dev/progress/10)

One important area of improvement for me is to become better at networking. It's fundamental to software development and an area I've noticed many times that I'm lacking a solid base in. I've improved a lot while working, but this is an area where I need to feel comfortable.

- Practice using web APIs ![](https://geps.dev/progress/50)  
- Study university course "Data communication in networks" ![](https://geps.dev/progress/10)
- Read initial chapters of "Computer Networking A Top-Down Approach" ![](https://geps.dev/progress/10)

***

## Docker ![](https://geps.dev/progress/40)  

Docker is a technology I want to be more comfortable with and debugging, modifying and working with containerized code is my focus.

- Learn debugging docker from tutorial ![](https://geps.dev/progress/100)  
- Create a docker app ![](https://geps.dev/progress/0)
