# Self Improvement

Plans and progress tracking for improving.  

## Communication ![](https://geps.dev/progress/100)  

Improving my knowledge of standards for documenting and communicating software, such as UML, would improve my communication with others and improve my own coding.  

- Review UML ![](https://geps.dev/progress/100)  
- Draw algorithms to practice through university course in robotics ![](https://geps.dev/progress/100) 
- Start using flowcharts more for coding projects ![](https://geps.dev/progress/100)

## Improve coding knowledge outside of C#  ![](https://geps.dev/progress/75)  

Widening my knowledge outside of C# is fun and makes me appreciate what how much I've learned.

- University course on Python ![](https://geps.dev/progress/100)
- University course on Android development ![](https://geps.dev/progress/75)
- Beginner course on .NET MAUI ![](https://geps.dev/progress/75)
- Own coding project with .NET MAUI ![](https://geps.dev/progress/5)

## Testing ![](https://geps.dev/progress/30)  

I really enjoy writing test code and finding bugs in code. But there are many different ways of writing and thinking about test code that I've encountered among collegues. I want to be competent to find bugs and feel that I'm producing quality code.  

- Listen to podcasts on testing: Coding Blocks ![](https://geps.dev/progress/100) 
- Write tests for private projects ![](https://geps.dev/progress/60) 
- Read: "C and .NET Core Test-Driven Development" ![](https://geps.dev/progress/20)  
- Read: "The Art of Software Testing" ![](https://geps.dev/progress/20)

## Software Architecture ![](https://geps.dev/progress/30)

To get better at writing bigger pieces of maintainable software.  

- Listen to podcasts on architecture: Coding Blocks ![](https://geps.dev/progress/70)
- Study design patterns: Read "Head First Design Patterns" ![](https://geps.dev/progress/50)  
- Read parts of "Designing Data Intensive Applications" ![](https://geps.dev/progress/10)
- Write more ![](https://geps.dev/progress/50)

## Best practices, productivity and wellbeing ![](https://geps.dev/progress/30)

Something I'm constantly learning, re-learning and sometimhes struggling with. It's lucky I really enjoy it! 

- Read "The Pragmatic Programmer" ![](https://geps.dev/progress/30)
- Develop exercise and training routines ![](https://geps.dev/progress/50)

## Networking  ![](https://geps.dev/progress/10)

One important area of improvement for me is to become better at networking. It's fundamental to software development and an area I've noticed many times that I'm lacking a solid base in. I've improved a lot while working, but this is an area where I need to feel comfortable.

- Practice using web APIs. Google APIs ![](https://geps.dev/progress/100)  
- University course "Data communication in networks" ![](https://geps.dev/progress/10)
- Read initial chapters of "Computer Networking A Top-Down Approach" ![](https://geps.dev/progress/10)

***

## Docker ![](https://geps.dev/progress/40)  

Docker is a technology I want to be more comfortable with and debugging, modifying and working with containerized code is my focus.

- Learn debugging docker from tutorial ![](https://geps.dev/progress/100)  
- Create a docker app ![](https://geps.dev/progress/0)
